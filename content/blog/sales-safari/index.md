Sales Safari is the research method that can be used to identify where others are struggling and need help in a particular area. The idea is to see how people talk and act 'out in the wild' about the pains that they experience learning the technology that you're interested in teaching about or building a product around.

The method is focused on answering the questions:
- What does your audience need?
- What does your audience want?
- What does your audience buy?

You can read more how I describe the process here:

This method was created by Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman. They've written about the method in several places which I highly recommend:
